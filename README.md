KITSUNE NETWORK ATTACK – MIRAI DATASET

OBJECTIVE:
The main objective of this project is to study a classification problem using a dataset [Kitsune Network Attack – Mirai dataset] in UCI Machine Learning Repository. Fundamental concepts of machine learning are applied to the dataset. Evaluate and interpret the performance based on observed dataset. The analysis is divided into four sections, that are saved as single (.ipynb) file. 

1. Understanding the dataset
2. Visualizing the data
3. Pre-processing the data
4. Build the model whether to predict the packet is malignant or benign. 

STEPS TO INSTALL:

- This project requires Jupyter Notebook to execute. 
- To Install Jupyter Notebook, go to terminal and run the following command.
$pip install jupyter
- Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, It can be launched by running the command below,
$ jupyter notebook
- This command will start the Jupyter Notebook and opens it in a browser. 

STEPS TO RUN THIS CODE:

- Download the Mirai_Dataset.csv and Mirai_label.csv from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Kitsune+Network+Attack+Dataset.
- To run the code, save the python file and dataset to the Jupyter Notebook directory. 
- Now, open the Jupyter Notebook and provide the path of the dataset in the second cell to read the datasets. Different classification models have been built.
o The first part of the code reads the given dataset
o The second part of the code visualizes the data
o Next part of the code Pre-Process the data.
o Four model is built to predict the packets attacked or not
o Improved the performance by fine tuning the hyperparameter at the last part of the code.
- Each cell can be executed by using (Command+rReturn) key or all cells can be executed at a time by clicking on double arrow button. 
- Run each models to compare the performance of different classifiers.
(Recommended to run each cell without skipping as it will interrupt the flow of data processing)
